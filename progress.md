# progress.md: Imervue

Outstanding work only. When an item is done, delete it in the same commit and add a `#done` entry to `docs/updates/` (format and query commands: `docs/updates/README.md`). No finished items, no history, no rules (rules live in `CLAUDE.md`).
Item numbers (`#n`) are never reused. Tags: [DECIDE] needs the owner's decision, [BLOCKED] waits on something else, [UNVERIFIED] observed but not confirmed.
Cross-repo and workspace items live in `D:\Codes\progress.md` (relevant here: S-10, X-9, X-10, X-18).

## Open

- **#4** 11 files are over the 1000-line limit (`architecture_explore.md` §12); the largest are `Imervue/Imervue_main_window.py` (2268) and `Imervue/paint/canvas.py` (1852).
- **#10** [DECIDE] `examples/*.puppet` (≈37 MB) is tracked; `march_7th.puppet` is a third-party character and `release.yml` packs `examples/` into the EXE — copyright and redistribution risk.
- **#12** [DECIDE] `.idea/deployment.xml` is no longer tracked, but this is a public repository and every commit from `6ecc332` (2026-02-13) up to U-20260922-03 still contains it, SFTP user@IP:port included. Either rewrite history (force push to `main` and `dev`) or treat the address as public and harden or move that server (workspace S-10).
