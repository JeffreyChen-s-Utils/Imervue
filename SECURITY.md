# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest release and the default
branch. Older releases are not supported. Upgrade before reporting
an issue that may already be fixed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue, pull request, or discussion for a suspected
vulnerability.

Use either private channel:

- **GitHub Security Advisories.** Open a private report from this
  repository's Security tab, **Report a vulnerability**. This is the
  preferred channel.
- **Email.** `jechenmailman@gmail.com`, with a subject line that begins
  with `[SECURITY]`.

Include the affected version, platform, impact, and steps to reproduce.
Do not attach credentials, tokens, or unredacted logs.

The maintainers aim to acknowledge a report within 5 business days, and
to coordinate a fix and disclosure within 90 days. There is no bug-bounty
promise.

## Operational notes

Imervue is a local image application. A plugin is code. Load only plugins
you trust.

Cancelling a video export does not stop the encoder process. It can keep
running until its timeout, about five minutes. Wait for that process to exit
before you treat the export as cancelled.
