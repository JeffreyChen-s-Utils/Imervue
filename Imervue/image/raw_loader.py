"""Memory-efficient RAW image loading.

``rawpy.imread(path)`` is the convenience entry point but it
reads the entire file into a Python ``bytes`` object before
handing it to libraw. For a 50 MB CR3 / NEF that's a redundant
copy on top of the decoded RGB buffer libraw produces — roughly
doubles the peak memory during a deep-zoom load.

This module routes around the convenience path:

* :func:`open_raw_efficient` uses ``RawPy.open_file`` — libraw's
  native file API, which streams from disk via the OS page cache
  instead of reading the whole file into Python memory first.
* :func:`open_raw_via_mmap` is a fallback for callers that need
  the buffer API (e.g. when reading from a custom file-like
  object), wrapping the file as ``mmap.mmap`` so libraw still
  operates on OS-managed memory rather than a Python ``bytes``
  copy.

Both helpers return an *unpacked* :class:`rawpy.RawPy` ready for
``postprocess`` / ``extract_thumb`` — same shape as the convenience
function but cheaper on memory.

The module imports ``rawpy`` lazily inside each helper so the
import cost is only paid when a RAW file is actually loaded;
JPEG-only sessions don't pull rawpy at all.
